This repository contains experimental software that enables separable
compilation in Chisel.

This repository seeks to answer questions related to:

1. What is the _interface_ between separately compiled Chisel modules?

2. How to define a stable port-level interface between Chisel modules?

3. How can information, other than ports, be included in an interface?

4. What information can be passed between separable compilation units?

5. How can information that requires an interface implementation be described
   and communicated?

6. What software patterns are applicable to this problem?
